  In this project the potential of blockchain technology to analyze power consumption in decision tree algorithms is to explore how much power is consumed in individual households daily, hourly, weekly and yearly. Based on this, it helps the user see how much electricity is consumed and can help to identify areas where energy efficiency can be improved, potentially saving you money on your energy bills.To provide you with an understanding of your overall energy consumption, it helps you to make more informed decisions about how to reduce your energy use.
