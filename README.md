# Power-consumption-using-decision-tree-algorithm-in-block-chain-technology
  In this project the potential of blockchain technology to analyze power consumption in decision tree algorithms. By distributing the computation over a blockchain, the power consumption can be reduced as compared to running the same algorithm on a single machine.The project also looks at the possibility of implementing a consensus mechanism to increase the accuracy of the results, while also providing a secure platform for data storage and access. Finally, the project will look into the possibility of integrating blockchain with decision tree algorithms to further analysis the power consumption. 
  To analyze the electric power consumption can be useful for the household determining the major power utilization facilities and helping the individual household make decisions of how much power is consumed based on the patterns.
Knowing how much electricity is consumed can help to identify areas where energy efficiency can be improved, potentially saving you money on your energy bills. 
To provide you with an understanding of your overall energy consumption, helping you to make more informed decisions about how to reduce your energy use.
It can also help you to identify any potential safety issues, such as overloaded circuits.
